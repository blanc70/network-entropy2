README

"Network-entropy2" calculate the entropy of packets, segments or frames on the network.

Parameters to send to the program will be:
-The input: the file, the capture, the network interface on which is calculated the entropy.
-The algorithm chosen
-The output: file (json, xml), console

For example :
networkentropy -i capture.cap -a shannon -o result.txt

The following algorithms will be Used:
-Shannon.
-Kolmogorov.
-LZW (ZIF).
-Maybe other algorithms if we have the time.

It's implemented at the moment:
-Shannon.
-Calculation of entropy on a file.
-Class diagram: an abstract class "AbstractAlgorithm","AbstractEntropyAlgorithm" inherits "AbstractAlgorithm".
The entropy algorithms inherit "AbstractEntropyAlgorithm".

They remain to do:
-Kolmogorov.
-Extraction of packets.
-Live capture. 
-If we have the time,Calculation of distances between results vectors and establishment of a database on statistics.
